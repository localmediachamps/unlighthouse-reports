If you are an Authorized User, references in these Terms to Customer are references to the Provider customer with respect to which you are an Authorized User.</p><p>Each Customer, together with all its Authorized Users as at any specified time of determination, are with respect to such Customer the “<em>Customer Parties</em>”.</p><p>We and you are, together, the “<em>Parties</em>”.</p><h3>1       Customers and Authorized Users Only</h3><p>The Services, including any restricted access portion of the Applications and the Websites, are for Customers and Authorized Users <strong>ONLY</strong>.

To qualify to create an account, you must be a Customer or Authorized User, and, if you are an individual, at least eighteen years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is older, and it must be lawful for you to create an Account and to register for, download, install, access, and otherwise use the Services or any other Provider Property or any part thereof (all such activities constituting “<em>using</em>” the Services for purposes of these Terms), in the country in which you reside. Only you may use your Account. You will not disclose any element of your Access Means (as defined below) to any other person or otherwise cause or permit any other person to use your Account for any purpose. You may delete your Account at any time through your Account profile. We may in our sole discretion, at anytime and without any prior notice or liability to you, suspend or terminate your Account. We may also in our sole discretion, at any time and without any prior notice or liability to you, use any operational, technological, legal, or other means at our disposal to enforce these Terms. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, we expressly reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Account, at any time and without any prior notice or liability to you, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have or any other Customer Party has violated these Terms in any respect or engaged in any unlawful, improper, or inappropriate conduct in connection with using the Services, or for any other reason we deem in our sole discretion justifies such suspension or termination.</p><h3>3       Binding Agreement</h3><p>By using the Services in any respect, you:</p><p>(a)      Acknowledge that you have read and understand these Terms.</p><p>(b)     Represent that you are a Customer or an Authorized User of a Customer.</p><p>(c )     Represent that, if you are an individual, you are at least eighteen years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction whichever is older.</p><p>(d)     Accept these Terms and agree that you are legally bound by them.</p><p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Services in any respect, and immediately delete the Applications from any device on which you may have installed them.</p><h3>4       Service Plans</h3><p>We provide the Services under a number of plans tailored to the needs of our Customers, the fees, payment schedule, and initial and renewal term terms and conditions for which we may publish from time to time on the Websites or convey to and confirm with a Customer directly through written communications (each, a “<em>Service Plan</em>”). The latest Service Plan that a Customer has selected and not cancelled or replaced with a different Service Plan is such Customer’s “<em>Selected Service Plan</em>”.</p><h3>5       Access and Use</h3><h4>5.1      Rights Grant</h4><p>If you are a Customer, we hereby grant you, strictly subject to and conditioned on your payment of all applicable Fees, and your and the other Customer Parties’ compliance with all other terms and conditions these Terms contain, a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to cause and permit your Authorized Users’ to use the Services for your own internal business purposes.

Customer will be responsible and liable for all use of the Services and other Provider Property resulting from use that Customer directly or indirectly authorizes, permits, provides, enables, or facilitates, whether these Terms permit or prohibit such use. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, Customer will be responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of its Authorized Users. Any Authorized User’s act or omission that would constitute a breach of these Terms if Customer had taken such act or made such omission will be deemed a breach of these Terms by Customer.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of an individual, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.</p><h3>23    Indemnification</h3><h4>23.1     Provider Indemnification as Indemnitor</h4><p>We will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Customer from and against all damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, expenses, and other losses of any kind and to any extent whatsoever, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (collectively, “<em>Losses</em>”),Customer incurs in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding brought by any third party to the extent such Losses result from any claim that the Services infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate, or that Customer’s use of the Services strictly in accordance with these Terms infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates, such third party’s United States intellectual property rights. If Customer wishes to seek indemnification or defense from us under this <em>Section 23.1</em>,Customer will promptly notify us in writing of the action, suit, or proceeding brought against Customer with respect to which Customer seeks indemnification or defense. We may not enter into any settlement agreement or other contract in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding that would in any way whatsoever affect Customer’s rights, constitute an admission of fault by Customer, or bind Customer in any manner, without Customer’s agreement. This <em>Section 23.1</em>constitutes Customer’s sole remedies and our sole liability and obligation for any actual, threatened, or alleged claims that the Services infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate, or that Customer’s use of the Services infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates, any third party’s intellectual property rights. This <em>Section 23.1</em>will not apply to the extent that any alleged infringement, misappropriation, or other violation is based upon, arises from, or relates to Customer Data or any claim with respect to which Customer is obligated pursuant to <em>Section 23.2 </em>to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend us.</p><h4>23.2     Customer Indemnification as Indemnitor</h4><p>Customer will indemnify, hold harmless, and, at our option, defend us from and against all Losses we incur in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding brought by any third party, to the extent such Losses result from (the following, collectively, “<em>Customer Indemnified Claims</em>”):</p><p>(a)      Any claim that any Customer Data, or any processing of Customer Data strictly in accordance with these Terms, infringes or misappropriates such third party’s United States intellectual property rights.</p><p>(b)     Customer’s or any of its representatives’ (including any Authorized User’s):</p><p>(i)       Negligence or willful misconduct.</p><p>(ii)      Access to or use of the Services in a manner these Terms do not authorize.</p><p>(iii)     Access to or use of the Services in combination with data, software, hardware, equipment, or technology we have not provided or authorized in writing.</p><p>(iv)    Modifications to the Services that we have not made or authorized in writing.</p><p>If we wish to seek indemnification or defense from Customer under this <em>Section 23.2</em>, we will promptly notify Customer in writing of the action, suit, or proceeding brought against us with respect to which we seek indemnification or defense. We reserve the right, at our option and in our sole discretion, to assume full control of the defense of claims with legal counsel of our choice. Customer may not enter into any settlement agreement or other contract in connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding that would in any way whatsoever affect our rights, constitute an admission of fault by us, or bind us in any manner, without our agreement. This <em>Section 23.2 </em>constitutes our sole remedies and Customer’s sole liability and obligation for any actual, threatened, or alleged Customer Indemnified Claim.</p><h4>23.3    Mitigation</h4><p>If any of the Services or Provider Property infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third party’s intellectual property rights (or if we believe in good faith that any person is likely to so claim),or if Customer’s or any Authorized User’s use of the Services or Provider Property is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, we may, at our option and sole cost and expense:</p><p>(a)      Obtain the right for Customer to continue to use the Services and Provider Property materially as these Terms contemplate.</p><p>(b)  Modify or replace the Services and Provider Property, in whole or in part, to seek to make the Services and Provider Property (as so modified or replaced) non-infringing, while providing materially equivalent features and functionality, in which case such modifications or replacements will constitute Services and Provider Property, as applicable, under these Terms.</p><p>(c ) By notice to Customer, terminate the Term with respect to all or part of the Services and Provider Property, and require Customer to immediately cease any use of the Services and Provider Property or any specified part or feature thereof.</p><h4>23.4    User Indemnification as Indemnitor</h4><p>You are solely responsible for all actions you take in connection with using the Services and other Provider Property, including all Your Content that you input, upload, or otherwise provide or make available to or through the Services. Accordingly, you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us and our officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and assigns from and against any and all Losses based upon, arising out of, or relating to your:</p><p>(a)      Violation of any law or the rights of any third party.</p><p>(b)     Negligent acts or omissions or willful misconduct.</p><p>(c )   Use or misuse of the Services or any other Provider Property.</p><p>(d)     Inputting, uploading, or otherwise providing or making available any of Your Content, including any Prohibited Content Your Content may at any time contain or have contained.</p><p>(e)      Breach of these Terms.</p><p>We retain the exclusive right to settle ,compromise, and pay without your prior consent any and all claims or causes of action that are brought against us and for which you are obligated to indemnify us pursuant to this <em>Section 23.4</em>. If we ask, you will co-operate fully and reasonably as we may require in the defense of any relevant claim. This <em>Section 23.4</em>does not require you to indemnify us for any unconscionable commercial practice on our part or any fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation, or concealment, suppression, or omission on our part of any material fact in connection with the Services.</p><h3>24     Liability Limitations</h3><h4>24.1    Excluded Losses</h4><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary these Terms may contain, in no event will we or any of our affiliates or any of our or their licensors, service providers, or suppliers be liable to you or any other person, including any other Customer Party, under any legal or equitable theory, whether for breach of contract, tort (including negligence),proprietary rights infringement, strict product liability, or otherwise, for any of the following Losses that you or any such other person may incur based upon, arising out of, or relating to the Services or any other Provider Property, including your r use of or inability to use any of the foregoing, regardless of whether we or any of our affiliates or any of our or their licensors, service providers, or suppliers were advised of the possibility of such Losses, or whether such Losses were otherwise foreseeable (collectively, “<em>Excluded Losses</em>”):</p><p>(a)       Consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary, special, enhanced, or punitive damages.</p><p>(b)      Increased costs, diminution in value, or lost business, production, use, revenues, income, or profits.</p><p>(c )     Loss of goodwill or reputation.</p><p>(d)      Loss or damage resulting from, arising out of, or relating to:</p><p>(i)       Personal injury or property damage.</p><p>(ii)      Computer failure or malfunction.</p><p>(iii)     Impairment, inability to use, loss, interruption, delay of the Services.</p><p>(iv)    Loss, damage, corruption, or recovery of any data.</p><p>(v)      Breach of data or system security.</p><p>(e)       Cost of replacement or substitute goods or services.</p><p>You will not, and you hereby knowingly, fully, and irrevocably waive to the fullest extent applicable law permits all rights of any kind you ever had, now have, or hereafter can, may, or will have to, make any claim, or bring any action, suit, or proceeding, to recover any Excluded Losses.</p><h4>24.2    Liability to Customer</h4><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary these Terms may contain, in no event will our and our licensors, service providers, and suppliers collective aggregate liability to Customer arising out of or related to these Terms and the Services under any legal or equitable theory, whether for breach of contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise, exceed the lesser of the aggregate amount Customer has paid to us under these Terms during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the occurrence of the events upon which our liability is based and $1,000,000.The foregoing limitations will apply even if any Customer remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p><h4>24.3    Liability to All Other Users</h4><p>Unless you are a Customer, notwithstanding anything to the contrary these Terms may contain, in in no event will we or our licensors, service providers, or suppliers be liable to you to any extent for any Losses based upon, arising out of, or related to the Services or any other Provider Property or our relationship with you under these Terms under any legal or equitable theory, whether for breach of contract, tort(including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise. If you are dissatisfied in any way with the Services or any other Provider Property, your sole and exclusive remedy is to stop your using the Services and other Provider Property. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages, so some or all of the above limitations of liability may not apply to you. If any part of the above limitations on liability is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, then our aggregate liability to you will not exceed $100.00. </p><h4>24.4    Reasonable Limitations</h4><p>The above limitations of liability are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between us and reflect a fair allocation of risk. We would not provide you the Services or any other Provider Property without the full extent of legal protections such limitations are intended to provide us. You agree that the limitations and exclusions of liability, disclaimers, and exclusive remedies these Terms contain are reasonable in all respects and will survive even if found to have failed in their essential purpose.</p><h3>25    Severability</h3><p>In entering into these Terms, each Party wishes to fully exercise such Party’s constitutional freedoms to contract as such Party sees fit. Accordingly, each Party hereby waives any right such Party may have to assert, allege, demand, petition, or otherwise claim in any Designated Action that any provision of these Terms is illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable or enforceable only if modified, in whole or in part, by reason of any applicable law or public policy (whether now or hereafter in effect). If, however, any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction (in each case, the “<em>Invalidating Jurisdiction</em>”) declares any provision of these Terms illegal, invalid, or other wise unenforceable or enforceable only if modified, in whole or in part ,by reason of any applicable law or public policy (whether now or hereafter in effect), and such declaration becomes final and non-appealable (in each case, the “<em>Invalidated Provision</em>”), then such Invalidated Provision will remain in full force and effect in all respects as originally written in all jurisdictions other than the Invalidating Jurisdiction and will remain in full force and effect in the Invalidating Jurisdiction to the extent applicable law permits, and all other provisions these Terms contain will remain in full force and effect in their entirety and thereafter construed so as to give the greatest legally permissible effect to the original intent of the Parties with respect to the Invalidated Provision. Each Party will negotiate in good faith to replace as soon as practicable any Invalidated Provision with a provision applicable in the Invalidating Jurisdiction that is legal, valid, and enforceable in the Invalidating Jurisdiction, and that will achieve to the greatest extent possible the same business purposes, and the same allocation of economic and legal benefits and burdens, as such Invalidated Provision would have, had it been legal, valid, and enforceable in the Invalidating Jurisdiction.</p><h3>26    Third-Party App Store</h3><p>If you download any Application from a third-party app store (such store, the “<em>Third-Party App Store</em>”), the additional term sand conditions that this <em>Section 26</em>contains will apply to your use of such Application. If any term or condition of these Terms is less restrictive than or otherwise conflicts with any term or condition that this <em>Section 26</em>contains, the more restrictive or conflicting term or condition of this <em>Section 26</em>with apply, but solely with respect to such Application and the Third-Party AppStore. You acknowledge and agree that:</p><p>(a)      These Terms are concluded solely between you and us and not with the Third-Party App Store provider.</p><p>(b)     We, not the Third-Party App Store provider, are solely responsible for such Application and the content of such Application.</p><p>(c )     If these Terms provide for access and usage rules for such Application that are less restrictive or in conflict with the applicable terms of service of the Third-Party App Store, the more restrictive or conflicting term of the Third-Party App Store will take precedence and will apply.</p><p>(d)     The Third-Party App Store provider has no warranty obligation or obligation to provide any maintenance and support services with respect to such Application.</p><p>We, not the Third-Party App Store provider, are solely responsible for:</p><p>(a)      Any Application product warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not effectively disclaimed.</p><p>(b)     Any other Losses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty.</p><p>(c )     Any claims you or any third party may have relating to such Application or your possession or use of such Application ,including product liability claims; claims that such Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and intellectual property infringement claims.</p><p>The Third-Party App Store provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and, upon your acceptance of these Terms, the Third-Party App Store provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof. If any conflict exists between the Third-Party App Store provider’s or any mobile carrier’s applicable terms and conditions and these Terms, the terms and conditions of the Third-Party App Store provider or mobile carrier, as the case may be, will govern and control. We are not responsible and have no liability whatsoever for third-party goods or services you obtain through the Third-Party App Store or any mobile carrier.</p><h3>27    Dispute Resolution</h3><p>You and we will resolve all disputes or claims relating directly or indirectly or in whole or in part to these Terms, your Account, or your relationship with us, including your use of the Services or any other Provider Property or any part thereof (collectively, the “<em>Designated Claims</em>”),except for suits for equitable relief for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights, or for breaches or threatened breach of <em>Section 15</em>(“Confidentiality”), that you or we bring in a Designated Court (collectively, “<em>Excluded Claims</em>”), by binding arbitration rather than by an action, suit, or proceeding before a court.</p><h4>27.1    Arbitration Request</h4><p>To begin the arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: The Corporation Trust Company, Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.</p><h4>27.2    Arbitration</h4><p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration agreement these Terms contain (this “<em>Arbitration Agreement</em>”). Any arbitration brought under this Arbitration Agreement will be governed by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. All Designated Claims involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/. All other Designated Claims will be subject to JAMS’s most current version of its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at:http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The arbitrator will have the exclusive authority to:</p><p>(a)      Determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>(b)     Resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.</p><p>(c )     Grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Designated Claim.</p><p>(d)     Award monetary damages in respect of any Designated Claim.</p><p>(e)      Grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to any person under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms, including this Arbitration Agreement) in respect of any Designated Claim.</p><h4>27.3    Arbitration Award</h4><p>The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon you and us.</p><h4>27.4    Jury Trial Waiver</h4><p>By agreeing to arbitration, you and we are each agreeing to waive our rights to a jury trial in respect of Designated Claims. Instead, you and we are electing that all Designated Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><h4>27.5    Individual Arbitration</h4><p>All claims and disputes within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class or collective basis, and you give up your right to participate in a class action or any other class proceeding. Only individual relief is available and claims of more than one user cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other user. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this <em>Section 27</em>’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into a Designated Court. All other claims must be arbitrated.</p><h3>28    Successor and Assigns</h3><p>These Terms will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by only the Parties and their respective successors, executors, administrators, legal representatives, heirs, legatees, distributees, beneficiaries, and permitted transferees and assigns.</p><h3>29    No Third-Party Beneficiaries</h3><p>Except as these Terms otherwise expressly provide, these Terms for the sole benefit of the Parties and their respective heirs, administrators, legal representatives, executors, successors, and permitted assigns, and nothing in these Terms, whether express or implied, is intended to or will confer upon any other person, including any of our creditors, any legal or equitable right, benefit, remedy, power, or privilege of any kind.</p><h3>30    Governing law</h3><p>The internal laws of the State of Florida will exclusively govern the application, construction, validity, interpretation, and enforcement of these Terms and all matters based upon, arising out of, or relating to these Terms, the transactions between or among the Parties that these Terms contemplate (including your use of the Services), or any disagreement, controversy, cause of action, claim, or other dispute between or among any of the Parties based upon, resulting from, arising out of, or relating to these Terms or the Services. The Parties intend that the rights and remedies provided to each of them under these Terms be fully enforceable for their respective benefit, whether any such right or remedy would be enforceable under the laws, or by the courts, of any other jurisdiction other than the State of Florida.</p><h3>31    Submission to Jurisdiction</h3><p>Each Party hereby submits for it and its property to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts sitting in the city of Miami and county of Dade in the State of Florida (the “<em>Designated Venue Locale</em>”), and any appellate court therefrom (collectively, the “<em>Designated Courts</em>”) over all Excluded Claims and all Designated Claims that any court of competent jurisdiction finds cannot be resolved pursuant to and accordance with <em>Section 27</em>(“Dispute Resolution”). Each Party hereby waives any right such Party may have to bring any Designated Proceeding in any jurisdiction other than the State of Florida or in any court other than a Designated Court. Each Party hereby waives any right such Party may have to plead or make any objection to any Designated Court based on improper venue or <em>forum non conveniens</em>. Each Party hereby waives any right such Party may have to plead or make any claim that any Designated Proceeding brought in any Designated Court has been brought in an improper or otherwise inconvenient forum. Each Party hereby waives any right it may have to plead or make any claim that any Designated Court lacks personal jurisdiction over such Party. Any final governmental order in any Designated Proceeding will be conclusive as to all Parties. Each Party may enforce any final governmental order in any Designated Proceeding in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner applicable law provides. If a Party cannot under applicable law enforce a final governmental order in any Designated Proceeding in another jurisdiction by suit on the judgment, then, notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, such Party may bring such Designated Proceeding before the appropriate courts of such jurisdiction, and each Party hereby submits for it and its property to the jurisdiction of such courts for purposes of such Designated Proceeding.</p><h3>32    Jury Trial Waiver</h3><p>Each Party hereby acknowledges that any Excluded Claim or Designated Claim that any court of competent jurisdiction finds cannot be resolved pursuant to and accordance with <em>Section 27</em> (“Dispute Resolution”) is likely to involve complicated and difficult factual and legal issues. Accordingly, each Party hereby waives any right such Party may have to trial by jury in any Designated Proceeding.</p><h3>33    Enforcement Costs</h3><p>If we obtain a final and binding judgment against Customer in any Designated Proceeding, Customer will, in addition to payment of any damages required by such judgment, promptly and in any event within ten business days reimburse us for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, we incurred in connection with such Designated Proceeding.</p><h3>34    Limitation of Time to File Claims</h3><p>Any cause of action or claim you may have based upon, arising out of, or relating to these Terms or the Services or any other Provider Property must be commenced within one year after the cause of action accrues, otherwise such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.</p><h3>35    Electronic Communications</h3><p>All communications between you and us will take place by electronic means, including email and communication functionality built into(including our ability to post notices on or through) the Services.

The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights, including those under the <em>Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act</em> (<em>15 U.S.C. §§ 7001et. seq.</em>).</p><h3>36    Entire Agreement</h3><p>Except as these Terms otherwise expressly provide, these Terms and our <a href="https://www.xenia.team/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy </a>constitute the final, entire, and exclusive agreement between the Parties with respect to the Services and other Provider Property and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto.</p><h3>37    Modifications</h3><p>We reserve the right to amend, restate, supplement, or otherwise modify these Terms at any time and from time to time in our sole discretion (in each case, a “<em>Modification</em>”). Whenever we make a Modification, we will post it on this page and indicate the effective date of such Modification at the bottom of these Terms. In certain circumstances, we may send you an email notifying you of a Modification or ask you expressly to agree to such Modification. You should regularly check this page for notice of any Modification. Your or, if you are Customer, your Authorized Users’, continued use of the Services or any other Provider Property following any Modification constitutes your acceptance of such Modification and you will be legally bound by these Terms as modified by such Modification. If you do not accept any Modification, you must immediately stop using the Services and all other Provider Property.</p><h3>38    Waiver</h3><p>No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either Party, any right, power, or remedy under these Terms will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or remedy under these Terms preclude further exercise thereof, or of any other right, power, or remedy under these Terms. No waiver of any term of, or breach of, or default or misrepresentation under or in connection with, these Terms will be binding upon or enforceable against any Party unless such waiver is inwriting, expressly refers to these Terms and identifies in reasonable detail the subject term, breach, default, or misrepresentation, and is signed by the Party to be bound by such waiver.</p><h3>39    Assignment and Delegation</h3><p>No Party may or will assign or otherwise transfer its rights or delegate or otherwise transfer its obligations under or in connection with these Terms, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise. Any attempted assignment, delegation, or other transfer in violation of this Section <em>39</em> will be void.
